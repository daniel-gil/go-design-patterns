Go design patterns compilation based on the Udemy course [Go: Concurrency & Design Patterns for Gophers](https://www.udemy.com/learning-pathgo-concurrency-and-design-patterns-for-gophers/).

## Creational Patterns

[Singleton](./creational/singleton/README.md) provides a single instance of an object and guarantees that there are no duplicates.

### Builder
